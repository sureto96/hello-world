# hello-world
Creating my first repository on GitHub with the GitHub Guides tutorial.

My name is Cole Huffman. I am an entry-level developer learning my way around modern web technologies. A bit late in the game, I finished school in the spring semester of 2017. Since then, I have moved to Austin, TX where I have been focusing my energy on my first development job as well as learning the ropes of new tech. I'm definitely a dog person.
